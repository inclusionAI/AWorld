# Handoff Swarm Example
# Agents can hand off control to each other dynamically

swarm:
  name: "handoff_example"
  type: "handoff"
  root_agent: "agent1"
  
  agents:
    - id: "agent1"
    - id: "agent2"
    - id: "agent3"
  
  # Define handoff relationships using explicit edges
  edges:
    - from: "agent1"
      to: "agent2"
    - from: "agent1"
      to: "agent3"
    - from: "agent2"
      to: "agent3"
    - from: "agent3"
      to: "agent1"  # Can form cycles in handoff mode
