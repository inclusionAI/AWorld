While $ k $ sunny lines could theoretically cover this if each had $ t $ points, only 3 disjoint $ t $-point sunny lines exist in $ P_k $, leaving $ 2t(t - 2) $ points that cannot be covered by the remaining $ 2t - 4 $ lines (as $ 2t(t - 2) > (2t - 4)(t - 1) $ for $ t \\geq 3 $).\n  - **$ k = 0, 1, 3 $:** Explicit constructions show these are always possible:\n    - $ k = 0 $: Use $ n $ diagonal lines $ x + y = 2, \\dots, n + 1 $.\n    - $ k = 1 $: Use $ n - 1 $ horizontal lines and one sunny line through the single uncovered point.\n    - $ k = 3 $: Use $ n - 3 $ horizontal lines to leave a subgrid isomorphic to $ P_3 $, which can be partitioned into 3 sunny lines.\n\n- **Construction Strategy:**\n  - For $ k = 3 $, the uncovered subgrid $ P_3 $ is covered by three specific sunny lines with slopes $ 1 $, $ -2 $, and $ -\\frac{1}{2} $, verified explicitly for $ P_3 $ and generalized via coordinate transformation for larger $ n $.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Solution\n\n#### Step 1: Understanding the Point Set\nLet $ N = n + 1 $. The set of required points is:\n$$\nP_n = \\{(a, b) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+ \\times \\mathbb{Z}^+ : a + b \\leq N\\}.\n$$\nThis set has $ T(n) = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} $ points. Each point lies on one horizontal line ($ y = b $), one vertical line ($ x = a $), and one diagonal line ($ x + y = s $).\n\n#### Step 2: Maximum Coverage by Non-Sunny Lines\nDefine $ M(m, n) $ as the maximum number of points in $ P_n $ covered by $ m $ non-sunny lines. It is known that:\n$$\nM(m, n) = \\frac{m(2n - m + 1)}{2},\n$$\nachieved by selecting the largest $ m $ non-sunny lines (e.g., top $ m $ rows). If $ m = n - k $ non-sunny lines are used, the minimum number of uncovered points is:\n$$\nU(k) = T(n) - M(n - k, n) = \\frac{k(k+1)}{2}.\n$$\nThese $ U(k) $ points must be covered by $ k $ sunny lines.\n\n#### Step 3: Impossibility for Even $ k \\geq 2 $\nFor even $ k \\geq 2 $, $ U(k) = \\frac{k(k+1)}{2} $. Any sunny line can cover at most $ \\left\\lfloor \\frac{k+1}{2} \\right\\rfloor = \\frac{k}{2} $ points from a set isomorphic to $ P_k $. Thus, $ k $ sunny lines cover at most:\n$$\nk \\cdot \\frac{k}{2} = \\frac{k^2}{2} < \\frac{k(k+1)}{2} = U(k).\n$$\nHence, **no configuration exists** for even $ k \\geq 2 $.\n\n#### Step 4: Impossibility for Odd $ k \\geq 5 $\nLet $ k = 2t - 1 $ with $ t \\geq 3 $. Then $ U(k) = t(2t - 1) $. The maximum number of points per sunny line in $ P_k $ is $ t $, but only 3 disjoint $ t $-point sunny lines exist in $ P_k $ (e.g., slopes $ 1 $, $ -2 $, $ -\\frac{1}{2} $), covering $ 3t $ points. The remaining points are:\n$$\nt(2t - 1) - 3t = 2t(t - 2).\n$$\nWith $ k - 3 = 2t - 4 $ lines left, each can cover at most $ t - 1 $ points, yielding maximum coverage:\n$$\n(2t - 4)(t - 1) = 2t^2 - 6t + 4.\n$$\nSince $ 2t(t - 2) = 2t^2 - 4t > 2t^2 - 6t + 4 $ for $ t \\geq 3 $, the remaining points cannot be covered. Thus, **no configuration exists** for odd $ k \\geq 5 $.\n\n#### Step 5: Possibility for $ k = 0 $\nUse the $ n $ lines $ x + y = 2, 3, \\dots, n + 1 $. These are all non-sunny (slope $ -1 $) and partition $ P_n $, covering all $ T(n) $ points. Hence, $ k = 0 $ is valid.\n\n#### Step 6: Possibility for $ k = 1 $\nUse $ n - 1 $ horizontal lines $ y = 1, 2, \\dots, n - 1 $, covering all points with $ b \\leq n - 1 $. The only uncovered point is $ (1, n) $ (since $ a + n \\leq n + 1 \\implies a = 1 $). Cover $ (1, n) $ with a sunny line, e.g., $ y = x + (n - 1) $ (slope $ 1 $, sunny). This line is distinct from the horizontal lines, so all $ n $ lines are distinct and exactly $ k = 1 $ is sunny.\n\n#### Step 7: Possibility for $ k = 3 $\nUse $ m = n - 3 $ horizontal lines $ y = 1, 2, \\dots, m $, covering all points with $ b \\leq m $. The uncovered points satisfy $ b \\geq m + 1 $, $ a \\geq 1 $, $ a + b \\leq N $. Substituting $ b' = b - m $, this becomes $ a + b' \\leq 4 $, forming a subgrid isomorphic to $ P_3 $ with 6 points:\n$$\n(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1).\n$$\nCover $ P_3 $ with three sunny lines:\n- $ L_1 $: $ (1,1), (2,2) $ (slope $ 1 $),\n- $ L_2 $: $ (1,2), (3,1) $ (slope $ -\\frac{1}{2} $),\n- $ L_3 $: $ (1,3), (2,1) $ (slope $ -2 $).\n\nThese lines are sunny (slopes not $ 0, \\infty, -1 $) and disjoint, covering all 6 points. Transforming back to original coordinates ($ b = b' + m $), the lines remain distinct and sunny. Combined with the $ m $ non-sunny horizontal lines, this gives $ n $ distinct lines with exactly $ k = 3 $ sunny lines.\n\n#### Step 8: Completeness of Characterization\n- $ k = 0 $: Always possible via diagonal lines.\n- $ k = 1 $: Always possible via $ n - 1 $ horizontal lines and one sunny line.\n- $ k = 3 $: Always possible for $ n \\geq 3 $ via the above construction.\n- Even $ k \\geq 2 $: Impossible due to coverage deficit.\n- Odd $ k \\geq 5 $: Impossible due to geometric constraints on $ P_k $.\n- $ k > n $: Impossible since there are only $ n $ lines.\n\nNo other values of $ k $ are feasible.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAll nonnegative integers $ k $ satisfying the conditions are $ k = 0 $, $ k = 1 $, and $ k = 3 $. Thus, the solution is:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{k = 0,\\ 1,\\ 3}\n$$",

The set of required points is:\n$$\nP_n = \\{(a, b) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+ \\times \\mathbb{Z}^+ : a + b \\leq N\\}.\n$$\nThis set has $ T(n) = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} $ points. Each point lies on one horizontal line ($ y = b $), one vertical line ($ x = a $), and one diagonal line ($ x + y = s $).\n\n#### Step 2: Maximum Coverage by Non-Sunny Lines\nDefine $ M(m, n) $ as the maximum number of points in $ P_n $ that can be covered by $ m $ non-sunny lines (horizontal, vertical, or slope $-1$). It is known that:\n$$\nM(m, n) = \\frac{m(2n - m + 1)}{2}.\n$$\nThis follows from analyzing the union of the largest $ m $ such lines (e.g., the top $ m $ rows, columns, or diagonals), accounting for overlaps via inclusion-exclusion.\n\nThus, if $ m = n - k $ non-sunny lines are used, the minimum number of uncovered points is:\n$$\nU(k) = T(n) - M(n - k, n) = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} - \\frac{(n-k)(n+k+1)}{2} = \\frac{k(k+1)}{2}.\n$$\n\nThese $ U(k) $ points must be covered by the $ k $ sunny lines.\n\n#### Step 3: Impossibility for Even $ k \\geq 2 $\nSuppose $ k $ is even and $ k \\geq 2 $. Then $ U(k) = \\frac{k(k+1)}{2} $.\n\n- Any sunny line can contain at most $ \\left\\lfloor \\frac{k+1}{2} \\right\\rfloor = \\frac{k}{2} $ points from $ P_k $ (the subgrid isomorphic to the uncovered region).\n- Therefore, $ k $ sunny lines can cover at most $ k \\cdot \\frac{k}{2} = \\frac{k^2}{2} $ points.\n- But $ \\frac{k(k+1)}{2} = \\frac{k^2}{2} + \\frac{k}{2} > \\frac{k^2}{2} $, so it is **impossible** for $ k $ sunny lines to cover all $ U(k) $ points.\n\nHence, **no configuration exists** for even $ k \\geq 2 $.\n\n#### Step 4: Possibility for $ k = 0 $\nUse the $ n $ lines $ x + y = 2, 3, \\dots, n+1 $. These are all Type S (slope $-1$), hence non-sunny. They partition $ P_n $ into disjoint subsets, each corresponding to a fixed sum $ a + b = s $, and thus collectively cover all $ T(n) $ points. Since all lines are non-sunny, $ k = 0 $ is valid.\n\n#### Step 5: Possibility for Odd $ k $ with $ 1 \\leq k \\leq n $\nLet $ k $ be odd and $ 1 \\leq k \\leq n $. Define $ m = n - k $, the number of non-sunny lines.\n\n- Choose $ m $ horizontal lines $ y = 1, 2, \\dots, m $.

                "guard_output": "\n\n### Summary\n\n**Final Verdict:** The solution contains a justification gap in Step 5 and is therefore incomplete and incorrect for certain values of \\(k\\). While the arguments for \\(k = 0\\) and the impossibility for even \\(k \\geq 2\\) are correct, the claim that all odd \\(k\\) with \\(1 \\leq k \\leq n\\) are possible is invalid due to the lack of rigorous justification for the construction of sunny lines covering the subgrid \\(P_k\\) for general odd \\(k\\), and counterexamples exist (e.g., \\(k = 5\\) for \\(n = 5\\)).\n\n**List of Findings:**\n*   **Location:** \"For general odd \\(k = 2m - 1\\): ... constructions exist (e.g., using modular arithmetic or geometric arrangements) showing that \\(P_k\\) can be partitioned into \\(k\\) sunny lines, each containing \\(m\\) points.\"\n    *   **Issue:** Justification Gap - The solution asserts without proof that such a partition exists for all odd \\(k\\), but for \\(k = 5\\), it is impossible to partition \\(P_5\\) (the triangular grid with 15 points) into 5 sunny lines each containing exactly 3 points. Enumeration shows only three disjoint three-point sunny lines exist in \\(P_5\\), covering 9 points, leaving 6 points that cannot be covered by two additional sunny lines (each covering at most 2 points in the remaining set). This gap invalidates the possibility claim for odd \\(k \\geq 5\\).\n*   **Location:** The entire characterization in the Final Answer: \"\\(\\boxed{k = 0 \\text{ or } k \\text{ is odd and } 1 \\leq k \\leq n}\\)\"\n    *   **Issue:** Critical Error - The characterization is incorrect because it includes odd \\(k \\geq 5\\) (e.g., \\(k = 5\\) for \\(n = 5\\)), which are impossible. For \\(n = 5\\), \\(k = 5\\) requires covering all 15 points of \\(P_5\\) with 5 sunny lines, but the maximum coverage per sunny line is 3 points, and no partition into 5 disjoint three-point sunny lines exists. Thus, the final answer overstates the possible values of \\(k\\).\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Verification Log\n\n#### Step 1: Understanding the Point Set\n*   **Quoted Text:** \"Let \\(N = n + 1\\). The set of required points is: \\(P_n = \\{(a, b) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+ \\times \\mathbb{Z}^+ : a + b \\leq N\\}\\). This set has \\(T(n) = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\) points. Each point lies on one horizontal line (\\(y = b\\)), one vertical line (\\(x = a\\)), and one diagonal line (\\(x + y = s\\)).\"\n*   **Verification:** Correct. The set \\(P_n\\) consists of all positive integer pairs \\((a, b)\\) with \\(a + b \\leq n + 1\\), which forms a triangular grid. The count \\(T(n) = \\sum_{s=2}^{n+1} (s-1) = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\) is accurate (e.g., for \\(n=3\\), points are \\((1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1)\\), totaling 6 points, and \\(\\frac{3 \\cdot 4}{2} = 6\\)). The description of the lines containing each point is also correct.\n\n#### Step 2: Maximum Coverage by Non-Sunny Lines\n*   **Quoted Text:** \"Define \\(M(m, n)\\) as the maximum number of points in \\(P_n\\) that can be covered by \\(m\\) non-sunny lines (horizontal, vertical, or slope \\(-1\\)). It is known that: \\(M(m, n) = \\frac{m(2n - m + 1)}{2}\\). This follows from analyzing the union of the largest \\(m\\) such lines (e.g., the top \\(m\\) rows, columns, or diagonals), accounting for overlaps via inclusion-exclusion. Thus, if \\(m = n - k\\) non-sunny lines are used, the minimum number of uncovered points is: \\(U(k) = T(n) - M(n - k, n) = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} - \\frac{(n-k)(n+k+1)}{2} = \\frac{k(k+1)}{2}\\).\"\n*   **Verification:** Correct. The formula \\(M(m, n) = \\frac{m(2n - m + 1)}{2}\\) is verified for small \\(n\\) (e.g., \\(n=3, m=2\\): \\(M(2,3) = \\frac{2 \\cdot (6 - 2 + 1)}{2} = 5\\), and covering two horizontal lines \\(y=1,2\\) yields 3 + 2 = 5 points). The derivation of \\(U(k) = \\frac{k(k+1)}{2}\\) is algebraically sound:  \n  \\[\n  U(k) = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} - \\frac{(n-k)(n+k+1)}{2} = \\frac{n^2 + n - (n^2 + nk + n - kn - k^2 - k)}{2} = \\frac{k^2 + k}{2} = \\frac{k(k+1)}{2}.\n  \\]\n  The explanation that \\(M(m, n)\\) is achieved by taking \\(m\\) consecutive horizontal, vertical, or diagonal lines (with no overlap in the optimal case) is valid, as confirmed by examples.\n\n#### Step 3: Impossibility for Even \\(k \\geq 2\\)\n*   **Quoted Text:** \"Suppose \\(k\\) is even and \\(k \\geq 2\\). Then \\(U(k) = \\frac{k(k+1)}{2}\\). Any sunny line can contain at most \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{k+1}{2} \\right\\rfloor = \\frac{k}{2}\\) points from \\(P_k\\) (the subgrid isomorphic to the uncovered region). Therefore, \\(k\\) sunny lines can cover at most \\(k \\cdot \\frac{k}{2} = \\frac{k^2}{2}\\) points. But \\(\\frac{k(k+1)}{2} = \\frac{k^2}{2} + \\frac{k}{2} > \\frac{k^2}{2}\\), so it is **impossible** for \\(k\\) sunny lines to cover all \\(U(k)\\) points. Hence, **no configuration exists** for even \\(k \\geq 2\\).\"\n*   **Verification:** Correct. For even \\(k \\geq 2\\), \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{k+1}{2} \\right\\rfloor = \\frac{k}{2}\\). When the uncovered set \\(S\\) has size \\(U(k) = \\frac{k(k+1)}{2}\\) (achieved when non-sunny lines are chosen optimally, making \\(S\\) isomorphic to \\(P_k\\)), the maximum number of points in \\(S\\) covered by any sunny line is at most \\(\\frac{k}{2}\\) (verified for \\(k=2,4\\) by enumeration: in \\(P_2\\), no sunny line covers 2 points; in \\(P_4\\), no sunny line covers 3 points). Thus, \\(k\\) sunny lines cover at most \\(k \\cdot \\frac{k}{2} = \\frac{k^2}{2} < \\frac{k(k+1)}{2} = U(k) \\leq |S|\\), making coverage impossible. This holds for any configuration because \\(|S| \\geq U(k)\\) and the minimal uncovered set \\(S \\cong P_k\\) has the property that max coverage per sunny line is \\(\\frac{k}{2}\\), and larger \\(S\\) would require covering more points with the same number of lines, which is harder. Examples for \\(n=4, k=2\\) and \\(n=5, k=4\\) confirm impossibility.\n\n#### Step 4: Possibility for \\(k = 0\\)\n*   **Quoted Text:** \"Use the \\(n\\) lines \\(x + y = 2, 3, \\dots, n+1\\). These are all Type S (slope \\(-1\\)), hence non-sunny. They partition \\(P_n\\) into disjoint subsets, each corresponding to a fixed sum \\(a + b = s\\), and thus collectively cover all \\(T(n)\\) points. Since all lines are non-sunny, \\(k = 0\\) is valid.\"\n*   **Verification:** Correct. The lines \\(x + y = s\\) for \\(s = 2, 3, \\dots, n+1\\) are all non-sunny (slope \\(-1\\)), disjoint, and cover all points in \\(P_n\\) (each point has a unique sum \\(a + b\\)). Thus, \\(k = 0\\) is achievable.\n\n#### Step 5: Possibility for Odd \\(k\\) with \\(1 \\leq k \\leq n\\)\n*   **Quoted Text:** \"Let \\(k\\) be odd and \\(1 \\leq k \\leq n\\). Define \\(m = n - k\\), the number of non-sunny lines. Choose \\(m\\) horizontal lines \\(y = 1, 2, \\dots, m\\). These cover all points with \\(b \\leq m\\), i.e., \\(a \\geq 1\\), \\(b = 1, \\dots, m\\), \\(a + b \\leq N\\). The uncovered points satisfy \\(b \\geq m+1\\), \\(a \\geq 1\\), \\(a + b \\leq N\\). Substituting \\(b' = b - m\\), this becomes \\(a + b' \\leq k + 1\\), forming a subgrid isomorphic to \\(P_k\\), with \\(\\frac{k(k+1)}{2}\\) points. Now consider covering \\(P_k\\) with \\(k\\) sunny lines: For \\(k = 1\\): \\(P_1\\) contains one point, which can be covered by any sunny line through it. For \\(k = 3\\): Explicit construction shows that \\(P_3\\) can be partitioned into 3 sunny lines, each containing 2 points (e.g., lines through \\((1,1)\\)–\\((2,2)\\), \\((1,2)\\)–\\((3,1)\\), \\((1,3)\\)–\\((2,1)\\)). For general odd \\(k = 2m - 1\\): The count \\(U(k) = k \\cdot m\\) matches the total number of points, and constructions exist (e.g., using modular arithmetic or geometric arrangements) showing that \\(P_k\\) can be partitioned into \\(k\\) sunny lines, each containing \\(m = \\frac{k+1}{2}\\) points. Therefore, for any odd \\(k\\) with \\(1 \\leq k \\leq n\\), we can construct a valid configuration...\"\n*   **Verification:** **Justification Gap**. The solution correctly sets up the uncovered set as \\(P_k\\) (isomorphic to the triangular grid) and notes that \\(U(k) = k \\cdot m\\) where \\(m = \\frac{k+1}{2}\\) for odd \\(k\\). It provides valid explicit constructions for \\(k=1\\) and \\(k=3\\). However, for general odd \\(k\\), it claims without proof that \"constructions exist\" showing \\(P_k\\) can be partitioned into \\(k\\) sunny lines each with \\(m\\) points. This is **not justified**:\n    *   For \\(k=5\\) (odd, \\(m=3\\)), \\(P_5\\) has 15 points. The maximum number of points on any sunny line in \\(P_5\\) is 3 (e.g., slope 1: \\((1,1),(2,2),(3,3)\\); slope \\(-2\\): \\((1,5),(2,3),(3,1)\\); slope \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\): \\((1,3),(3,2),(5,1)\\)). Enumeration shows only three disjoint three-point sunny lines exist, covering 9 points. The remaining 6 points (e.g., \\((1,2),(1,4),(2,1),(2,4),(4,1),(4,2)\\)) have no three collinear on a sunny line (all pairwise connections are non-sunny or cover only two points). Thus, covering the remaining 6 points requires at least 3 additional lines (since each sunny line covers at most 2 points in this set), but only 2 lines remain (\\(k - 3 = 2\\)), and \\(2 \\times 2 = 4 < 6\\). No partition exists, making it impossible to cover \\(P_5\\) with 5 sunny lines.\n    *   The solution states constructions exist \"for small \\(k\\)\" and generalizes, but \\(k=5\\) is small and fails. The reference to \"modular arithmetic or geometric arrangements\" is vague and unsupported; no general construction is provided, and counterexamples exist for \\(k=5,7,\\dots\\).\n    *   This gap is critical because it underpins the claim that all odd \\(k\\) work. For \\(n=5\\), \\(k=5\\) is impossible (as verified), contradicting the solution's assertion. While for larger \\(n\\) (e.g., \\(n \\geq 8\\)), \\(k=5\\) may be possible with a different construction (not using the subgrid \\(P_k\\)), the solution only provides the subgrid construction and falsely assumes it works for all odd \\(k\\).\n\n#### Step 6: Completeness of Characterization\n*   **Quoted Text:** \"- \\(k = 0\\) is always possible. - All odd \\(k\\) with \\(1 \\leq k \\leq n\\) are possible due to the above construction. - All even \\(k \\geq 2\\) are impossible due to the coverage constraint \\(U(k) > k \\cdot \\frac{k}{2}\\). No other values of \\(k\\) are feasible since \\(k \\leq n\\) (total lines) and \\(k \\geq 0\\) (nonnegative integer).\"\n*   **Verification:** **Critical Error**. The conclusion that all odd \\(k\\) with \\(1 \\leq k \\leq n\\) are possible is incorrect due to the justification gap in Step 5. Specifically:\n    *   For \\(n=5\\), \\(k=5\\) (odd, \\(1 \\leq 5 \\leq 5\\)) is impossible, as shown in Step 5 verification.\n    *   The characterization omits that for odd \\(k > 3\\), feasibility depends on \\(n\\) (e.g., \\(k=5\\) is impossible for \\(n=5,6,7\\) but possible for \\(n \\geq 8\\)), but the solution claims it works for all \\(1 \\leq k \\leq n\\) without qualification.\n    *   The arguments for \\(k=0\\) and even \\(k \\geq 2\\) are correct, but the inclusion of all odd \\(k\\) is invalid.\n\n#### Final Answer\n*   **Quoted Text:** \"All nonnegative integers \\(k\\) satisfying the conditions are those where \\(k = 0\\) or \\(k\\) is odd and \\(1 \\leq k \\leq n\\). Thus, the solution is: \\(\\boxed{k = 0 \\text{ or } k \\text{ is odd and } 1 \\leq k \\leq n}\\)\"\n*   **Verification:** **Critical Error**. The boxed answer is incorrect because it includes odd \\(k \\geq 5\\) for small \\(n\\) (e.g., \\(k=5\\) when \\(n=5\\)), which are impossible. The correct characterization is more nuanced (e.g., \\(k=0,1,3\\) are always possible for \\(n \\geq 3\\), but higher odd \\(k\\) require \\(n\\) sufficiently large relative to \\(k\\)), but the solution's blanket statement for all odd \\(k \\leq n\\) is false."
