        "response": "\n\n### **1. Summary**\n\n#### **a. Verdict**  \nI have successfully solved the problem. The final answer is **4048**.\n\n#### **b. Method Sketch**  \nThe problem requires covering all but one square per row and column (forming a permutation matrix of uncovered squares) with disjoint axis-aligned rectangles. Key steps include:  \n\n- **Permutation Matrix Characterization**: The uncovered squares form a permutation matrix $ S = \\{(i, \\sigma(i)) : 1 \\leq i \\leq n\\} $. By symmetry (row/column permutations), we reduce to the case where $ S $ is the main diagonal $ \\{(i,i)\\} $.  \n- **Grid Partitioning**: The covered region splits into disjoint upper triangle $ U = \\{(i,j) : 1 \\leq i < j \\leq n\\} $ and lower triangle $ L = \\{(i,j) : 1 \\leq j < i \\leq n\\} $.  \n- **Rectangle Constraints**:  \n  - A rectangle spanning both $ U $ and $ L $ must include a diagonal cell (uncovered), violating tiling rules. Thus, $ U $ and $ L $ must be tiled independently.  \n  - For $ U $, define the **superdiagonal set** $ C = \\{(k, k+1) : 1 \\leq k \\leq n-1\\} $. Any rectangle covering two elements of $ C $ would include a diagonal cell, proving $ |C| = n-1 $ is a lower bound for $ U $. A matching construction using vertical strips achieves this bound.  \n  - For $ L $, define the **subdiagonal set** $ D = \\{(k+1, k) : 1 \\leq k \\leq n-1\\} $. Symmetrically, $ |D| = n-1 $ is a tight lower bound, achieved via horizontal strips.  \n- **Optimality**: The lower bounds for $ U $ and $ L $ are additive and achievable, yielding a total of $ 2(n-1) $ tiles.  \n\n---\n\n### **2. Detailed Solution**\n\nLet $ n = 2025 $. We determine the minimum number of axis-aligned rectangular tiles required to cover all but one unit square per row and column, with no overlaps and no coverage of uncovered squares.\n\n#### **Step 1: Characterization of Uncovered Squares**  \nEach row and column has exactly one uncovered square, so the uncovered set $ S $ forms a **permutation matrix**, i.e., $ S = \\{(i, \\sigma(i)) : 1 \\leq i \\leq n\\} $ for some permutation $ \\sigma $ of $ \\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\} $.  \n\nBy symmetry, row and column permutations preserve the grid structure and tiling constraints. Thus, without loss of generality, assume $ \\sigma(i) = i $, so $ S = \\{(i,i) : 1 \\leq i \\leq n\\} $ (the main diagonal). This reduction is valid because the minimal tile count depends only on the relative positions of uncovered squares, not their absolute coordinates.\n\n#### **Step 2: Partitioning the Grid**  \nThe complement of $ S $ is:  \n$$\n\\text{Complement}(S) = U \\cup L,\n$$  \nwhere:  \n- $ U = \\{(i,j) : 1 \\leq i < j \\leq n\\} $ (upper triangle),  \n- $ L = \\{(i,j) : 1 \\leq j < i \\leq n\\} $ (lower triangle).  \n\nThese sets are disjoint ($ U \\cap L = \\emptyset $) and symmetric under transposition ($ (i,j) \\in U \\iff (j,i) \\in L $).\n\n#### **Step 3: Rectangle Constraints Between $ U $ and $ L $**  \n**Claim**: No rectangle tile can span both $ U $ and $ L $.  \n\n**Proof**: Suppose a rectangle spans rows $ [r_1, r_2] $ and columns $ [c_1, c_2] $, containing cells from both $ U $ and $ L $. Then:  \n- There exists $ (i,j) \\in U \\cap \\text{rectangle} $, so $ i < j $,  \n- There exists $ (i',j') \\in L \\cap \\text{rectangle} $, so $ i' > j' $.  \n\nAssume for contradiction that the row and column intervals do not overlap, i.e., either $ r_2 < c_1 $ or $ c_2 < r_1 $.  \n- If $ r_2 < c_1 $, then for all $ (r,c) $ in the rectangle, $ r \\leq r_2 < c_1 \\leq c $, so $ r < c $. Thus, all cells are in $ U $, contradicting the presence of $ L $-cells.  \n- If $ c_2 < r_1 $, then for all $ (r,c) $ in the rectangle, $ c \\leq c_2 < r_1 \\leq r $, so $ c < r $. Thus, all cells are in $ L $, contradicting the presence of $ U $-cells.  \n\nHence, $ [r_1, r_2] \\cap [c_1, c_2] \\neq \\emptyset $. Let $ k \\in [r_1, r_2] \\cap [c_1, c_2] $. Then $ (k,k) \\in S $ (uncovered), but $ (k,k) $ lies in the rectangle, violating the tiling rule. Therefore, **all tiles must lie entirely within $ U $ or $ L $**.  \n\n#### **Step 4: Minimal Rectangles for Upper Triangle $ U $**  \n**Key Lemma**: The superdiagonal set $ C = \\{(k, k+1) : 1 \\leq k \\leq n-1\\} $ requires $ n-1 $ distinct rectangles to cover $ U $.  \n\n**Proof of Lower Bound**: Suppose a rectangle covers two elements $ (k, k+1), (m, m+1) \\in C $ with $ k < m $. The minimal rectangle containing both spans rows $ [k, m] $ and columns $ [k+1, m+1] $. Since $ k < m $, we have $ k+1 \\leq m $ (as $ k, m \\in \\mathbb{Z} $), so $ m \\in [k, m] $ (rows) and $ m \\in [k+1, m+1] $ (columns). Thus, $ (m, m) \\in S $ lies in the rectangle, which is invalid. Hence, **no two elements of $ C $ can share a rectangle**, implying at least $ |C| = n-1 $ rectangles for $ U $.  \n\n**Construction Achieving the Bound**: For $ 1 \\leq k \\leq n-1 $, define:  \n$$\nR_k = [1, k] \\times [k+1, k+1].\n$$  \n- **Disjointness**: Each $ R_k $ occupies column $ k+1 $, so $ R_k \\cap R_j = \\emptyset $ for $ k \\neq j $.  \n- **Coverage of $ U $**: For any $ (i,j) \\in U $, $ i < j $ implies $ j \\geq i+1 $. Set $ k = j-1 $; then $ i \\leq k $ (since $ i < j = k+1 $) and $ j = k+1 $, so $ (i,j) \\in R_k $.  \n- **Elements of $ C $**: Each $ R_k $ contains exactly $ (k, k+1) \\in C $.  \n\nThus, $ U $ can be tiled with $ n-1 $ rectangles, matching the lower bound.  \n\n#### **Step 5: Minimal Rectangles for Lower Triangle $ L $**  \nBy symmetry (transposing rows and columns), the same logic applies to $ L $. Define the subdiagonal set:  \n$$\nD = \\{(k+1, k) : 1 \\leq k \\leq n-1\\}.\n$$  \n- **Lower Bound**: Any rectangle covering two elements of $ D $ would include a diagonal cell (similar to Step 4), requiring at least $ |D| = n-1 $ rectangles.  \n- **Construction**: For $ 1 \\leq k \\leq n-1 $, define:  \n  $$\n  R'_k = [k+1, k+1] \\times [1, k].\n  $$  \n  - **Disjointness**: Each $ R'_k $ occupies row $ k+1 $, so $ R'_k \\cap R'_j = \\emptyset $ for $ k \\neq j $.  \n  - **Coverage of $ L $**: For any $ (i,j) \\in L $, $ j < i $ implies $ i \\geq j+1 $. Set $ k = i-1 $; then $ j \\leq k $ (since $ j < i = k+1 $) and $ i = k+1 $, so $ (i,j) \\in R'_k $.  \n  - **Elements of $ D $**: Each $ R'_k $ contains exactly $ (k+1, k) \\in D $.  \n\nThus, $ L $ can be tiled with $ n-1 $ rectangles, matching the lower bound.  \n\n#### **Step 6: Total Minimum Number of Tiles**  \nSince $ U $ and $ L $ are disjoint and require independent tiling (Step 3), the total minimum number of tiles is:  \n$$\n(n-1) + (n-1) = 2(n-1).\n$$  \nFor $ n = 2025 $:  \n$$\n2(2025 - 1) = 2 \\cdot 2024 = 4048.\n$$  \n\n#### **Step 7: Verification of Optimality**  \n- **Lower Bound**: Steps 4 and 5 establish that $ U $ and $ L $ each require at least $ n-1 $ rectangles due to the pairwise exclusion of elements in $ C $ and $ D $.  \n- **Achievability**: The constructions in Steps 4 and 5 achieve these bounds.  \n- **Symmetry Justification**: Any permutation matrix $ S $ can be transformed to the main diagonal via row/column permutations, which preserve the minimal tile count (as they bijectively map valid tilings to valid tilings).  \n\nThus, $ 2(n-1) $ is the global minimum for any $ n \\times n $ grid under the problem constraints.  \n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**  \n$$\n\\boxed{4048}\n$$",

Method Sketch**\nThe problem involves covering a $2025 \\times 2025$ grid with disjoint rectangular tiles such that each row and column has exactly one uncovered square (i.e., the uncovered squares form a permutation matrix). \n\n- **Key Insight**: The set of uncovered squares must be a permutation matrix due to the constraint of exactly one uncovered square per row and column.\n- **Symmetry Argument**: By permuting rows and columns, any permutation matrix can be transformed into the main diagonal without changing the minimal number of tiles required. Thus, it suffices to analyze the case where the uncovered squares are on the main diagonal.\n- **Decomposition**: The complement of the diagonal (the covered region) splits into two disjoint regions:\n  - **Upper Triangle (U)**: All cells $(i,j)$ with $1 \\leq i < j \\leq n$\n  - **Lower Triangle (L)**: All cells $(i,j)$ with $1 \\leq j < i \\leq n$\n- **Rectangle Constraints**: Any rectangle tile must lie entirely within either U or L because crossing between them would include a diagonal square (which is uncovered), violating the tiling rules.\n- **Minimal Rectangles for Triangles**:\n  - For the upper triangle $U$, define the superdiagonal set $C = \\{(k, k+1) : 1 \\leq k \\leq n-1\\}$. No two elements in $C$ can belong to the same rectangle due to geometric constraints. This gives a lower bound of $n-1$ rectangles for $U$. A matching construction using vertical strips achieves this bound.\n  - Similarly, for the lower triangle $L$, the subdiagonal set $D = \\{(k+1, k) : 1 \\leq k \\leq n-1\\}$ provides a lower bound of $n-1$ rectangles, which is also achievable via horizontal strips.\n- **Total Minimum Tiles**: Since the upper and lower triangles are independent and each requires $n-1$ rectangles, the total minimum number of tiles is $2(n-1)$.\n\n---\n\n### **2.

We aim to determine the minimum number of axis-aligned rectangular tiles needed to cover all but one unit square in each row and column of an $n \\times n$ grid, ensuring no overlaps and no coverage of the uncovered squares.\n\n#### **Step 1: Characterization of Uncovered Squares**\nEach row and column must contain exactly one uncovered square. Therefore, the set of uncovered squares forms a **permutation matrix**, i.e., a set $S = \\{(i, \\sigma(i)) : 1 \\leq i \\leq n\\}$ for some permutation $\\sigma$ of $\\{1, 2, ..., n\\}$.\n\nBy symmetry (via row and column permutations), we may assume without loss of generality that $\\sigma(i) = i$, so $S = \\{(i,i) : 1 \\leq i \\leq n\\}$ — the main diagonal.\n\n#### **Step 2: Partitioning the Grid**\nThe complement of $S$ consists of all unit squares not on the diagonal:\n$$\n\\text{Complement}(S) = U \\cup L,\n$$\nwhere:\n- $U = \\{(i,j) : 1 \\leq i < j \\leq n\\}$ (upper triangle),\n- $L = \\{(i,j) : 1 \\leq j < i \\leq n\\}$ (lower triangle).\n\nThese sets are disjoint and symmetric under transposition.\n\n#### **Step 3: Rectangle Constraints**\nAny rectangle tile must be fully contained within either $U$ or $L$, because:\n- If a rectangle spans both $U$ and $L$, then its row interval $[r_1, r_2]$ and column interval $[c_1, c_2]$ must overlap (since there exist $(i,j) \\in U$ and $(i',j') \\in L$ such that $i < j$ and $i' > j'$).\n- Overlapping intervals imply the existence of some $k$ such that $k \\in [r_1, r_2] \\cap [c_1, c_2]$, hence $(k,k) \\in S$, which is **uncovered** and thus cannot be part of any tile.\n\nTherefore, the tiling problem reduces to independently partitioning $U$ and $L$ into rectangles.\n\n#### **Step 4: Minimal Rectangles for Upper Triangle $U$**\nDefine the **superdiagonal set**:\n$$\nC = \\{(k, k+1) : 1 \\leq k \\leq n-1\\}.\n$$\nThis set has size $n-1$, and no two elements in $C$ can be covered by the same rectangle:\n- Suppose a rectangle covers $(k, k+1)$ and $(m, m+1)$ with $k < m$.\n- Then the rectangle must span rows $[k, m]$ and columns $[k+1, m+1]$.\n- However, this includes the cell $(m, m+1)$ and $(k, k+1)$, but also potentially $(m, m+1)$ and $(k, k+1)$, leading to inclusion of $(m, m)$, which is on the diagonal and therefore **uncovered**.\n- Hence, such a rectangle is invalid.\n\nThus, **each element of $C$ must be in a distinct rectangle**, giving a **lower bound** of $n-1$ rectangles for $U$.\n\nA **matching construction** exists:\n- For each $k = 1$ to $n-1$, define the rectangle:\n  $$\n  R_k = [1, k] \\times [k+1, k+1],\n  $$\n  which corresponds to column $k+1$, rows $1$ through $k$.\n- These rectangles are disjoint, cover all of $U$, and each contains exactly one element from $C$.\n\nHence, the **minimum number of rectangles** needed to partition $U$ is $n-1$.\n\n#### **Step 5: Minimal Rectangles for Lower Triangle $L$**\nBy symmetry (transposing rows and columns), the same logic applies to $L$.

                "guard_output": "\n\n### **1. Summary**\n\n#### **Final Verdict**  \nThe solution is **correct**. Every step is rigorously justified, and the reasoning aligns with IMO-level standards of mathematical proof.\n\n#### **List of Findings**  \n*No issues were found.*  \n- All arguments are logically sound, with no critical errors or justification gaps.  \n- Key steps (symmetry reduction, partitioning, lower bound derivation, and construction) are fully supported by precise reasoning.  \n- The final computation $2(2025 - 1) = 4048$ is accurate and follows from the validated reasoning.  \n\n---\n\n### **2. Detailed Verification Log**\n\n#### **Step 1: Characterization of Uncovered Squares**  \n> *\"Each row and column must contain exactly one uncovered square. Therefore, the set of uncovered squares forms a **permutation matrix**, i.e., a set $S = \\{(i, \\sigma(i)) : 1 \\leq i \\leq n\\}$ for some permutation $\\sigma$ of $\\{1, 2, ..., n\\}$.\"*  \n\n**Verification**:  \nThis is **correct**. A permutation matrix is defined as a binary matrix with exactly one 1 in each row and column, which directly corresponds to the condition that each row and column has exactly one uncovered square. The characterization is precise and foundational to the problem.  \n\n> *\"By symmetry (via row and column permutations), we may assume without loss of generality that $\\sigma(i) = i$, so $S = \\{(i,i) : 1 \\leq i \\leq n\\}$ — the main diagonal.\"*  \n\n**Verification**:  \nThis is **correct**. Row and column permutations are bijections that preserve the grid's structure and the tiling constraints. Since the problem is invariant under such permutations (the minimal number of tiles depends only on the relative positions of uncovered squares, not their absolute coordinates), reducing to the main diagonal case is valid. No gaps or errors exist here.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Step 2: Partitioning the Grid**  \n> *\"The complement of $S$ consists of all unit squares not on the diagonal: $\\text{Complement}(S) = U \\cup L$, where $U = \\{(i,j) : 1 \\leq i < j \\leq n\\}$ (upper triangle), $L = \\{(i,j) : 1 \\leq j < i \\leq n\\}$ (lower triangle). These sets are disjoint and symmetric under transposition.\"*  \n\n**Verification**:  \nThis is **correct**. The complement of the diagonal naturally splits into two disjoint regions: $U$ (above the diagonal) and $L$ (below the diagonal). The symmetry under transposition (swapping rows and columns) is a standard observation and is rigorously stated. No issues detected.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Step 3: Rectangle Constraints**  \n> *\"Any rectangle tile must be fully contained within either $U$ or $L$, because: If a rectangle spans both $U$ and $L$, then its row interval $[r_1, r_2]$ and column interval $[c_1, c_2]$ must overlap (since there exist $(i,j) \\in U$ and $(i',j') \\in L$ such that $i < j$ and $i' > j'$). Overlapping intervals imply the existence of some $k$ such that $k \\in [r_1, r_2] \\cap [c_1, c_2]$, hence $(k,k) \\in S$, which is **uncovered** and thus cannot be part of any tile.\"*  \n\n**Verification**:  \nThis is **correct and rigorous**. The argument hinges on the fact that for integer intervals $[r_1, r_2]$ and $[c_1, c_2]$, their intersection being non-empty implies the existence of a diagonal cell $(k,k)$ within the rectangle. This is a direct consequence of the definition of intervals over integers and ensures that any rectangle spanning both $U$ and $L$ would necessarily cover an uncovered square, violating the tiling rules. The logic is airtight and foundational to the rest of the solution.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Step 4: Minimal Rectangles for Upper Triangle $U$**  \n> *\"Define the **superdiagonal set**: $C = \\{(k, k+1) : 1 \\leq k \\leq n-1\\}$. This set has size $n-1$, and no two elements in $C$ can be covered by the same rectangle: Suppose a rectangle covers $(k, k+1)$ and $(m, m+1)$ with $k < m$. Then the rectangle must span rows $[k, m]$ and columns $[k+1, m+1]$. However, this includes the cell $(m, m)$, which is on the diagonal and therefore **uncovered**.\"*  \n\n**Verification**:  \nThis is **correct**. For $k < m$, the row interval $[k, m]$ and column interval $[k+1, m+1]$ intersect at $k+1 \\leq m$ (since $k < m \\implies k+1 \\leq m$), so $(m, m)$ lies in the rectangle. As $(m, m)$ is uncovered, the rectangle is invalid. Thus, no two elements of $C$ can share a rectangle, establishing a lower bound of $n-1$ rectangles for $U$.  \n\n> *\"A **matching construction** exists: For each $k = 1$ to $n-1$, define the rectangle $R_k = [1, k] \\times [k+1, k+1]$, which corresponds to column $k+1$, rows $1$ through $k$. These rectangles are disjoint, cover all of $U$, and each contains exactly one element from $C$.\"*  \n\n**Verification**:  \nThis is **correct**. Each $R_k$ is a vertical strip confined to column $k+1$, rows $1$ to $k$, ensuring no overlap with other $R_j$ (distinct columns). Every cell $(i,j) \\in U$ satisfies $i < j$, so $j \\geq i+1$. Setting $k = j-1$, we have $i \\leq k$ and $j = k+1$, so $(i,j) \\in R_k$. Thus, the construction covers all of $U$. Each $R_k$ contains exactly $(k, k+1) \\in C$, confirming the lower bound is tight. The reasoning is complete and rigorous.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Step 5: Minimal Rectangles for Lower Triangle $L$**  \n> *\"By symmetry (transposing rows and columns), the same logic applies to $L$. Define the **subdiagonal set**: $D = \\{(k+1, k) : 1 \\leq k \\leq n-1\\}$. No two elements in $D$ can share a rectangle, yielding a lower bound of $n-1$ rectangles for $L$.\"*  \n\n**Verification**:  \nThis is **correct**. Transposition maps $U$ to $L$ and preserves all tiling constraints. The subdiagonal set $D$ is the image of $C$ under transposition, so the same pairwise exclusion argument applies. The symmetry argument is valid and explicitly justified.  \n\n> *\"A matching construction uses horizontal strips: For each $k = 1$ to $n-1$, define the rectangle $R'_k = [k+1, k+1] \\times [1, k]$, which corresponds to row $k+1$, columns $1$ through $k$. These rectangles are disjoint, cover all of $L$, and each contains exactly one element from $D$.\"*  \n\n**Verification**:  \nThis is **correct**. Each $R'_k$ is a horizontal strip confined to row $k+1$, columns $1$ to $k$, ensuring disjointness (distinct rows). Every cell $(i,j) \\in L$ satisfies $j < i$, so $i \\geq j+1$. Setting $k = i-1$, we have $j \\leq k$ and $i = k+1$, so $(i,j) \\in R'_k$. The construction covers all of $L$, and each $R'_k$ contains exactly $(k+1, k) \\in D$. The reasoning is rigorous and mirrors Step 4 correctly.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Step 6: Total Minimum Number of Tiles**  \n> *\"Since the partitions of $U$ and $L$ are independent and disjoint, the total number of tiles required is: $(n-1) + (n-1) = 2(n-1)$.\"*  \n\n**Verification**:  \nThis is **correct**. Steps 3–5 establish that $U$ and $L$ must be tiled separately, with no shared rectangles. The lower bounds for $U$ and $L$ are additive, and the constructions achieve these bounds. Thus, the total minimum number of tiles is indeed $2(n-1)$.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Step 7: Verification of Optimality**  \n> *\"The lower bound of $2(n-1)$ follows directly from the pigeonhole principle applied to the sets $C$ and $D$, each of size $n-1$, where no two elements in either set can be covered by the same rectangle. The construction achieves this bound, confirming optimality.\"*  \n\n**Verification**:  \nThis is **correct**. The pigeonhole principle is appropriately applied: since $C$ requires $n-1$ distinct rectangles for $U$ and $D$ requires $n-1$ distinct rectangles for $L$, the total is at least $2(n-1)$. The explicit constructions for $U$ and $L$ achieve this bound, proving optimality. The argument is concise, rigorous, and complete.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Final Computation**  \n> *\"For $n = 2025$, this yields: $2(2025 - 1) = 2 \\cdot 2024 = 4048$.\"*  \n\n**Verification**:  \nThis is **correct**. The arithmetic is accurate, and the substitution $n = 2025$ into the formula $2(n-1)$ is valid based on the preceding reasoning.  \n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**  \nEvery step of the solution is logically sound, rigorously justified, and free of gaps or errors. The symmetry reduction, partitioning, lower bound derivation, and constructive proof all meet IMO standards. The final answer $\\boxed{4048}$ is correct and fully supported by the reasoning."
