        "response": "\n\n### **Summary**\n\n**a. Verdict:**  \nI have successfully solved the problem. The final answer is $ 4048 $.\n\n**b. Method Sketch:**  \nThe problem requires tiling a $ 2025 \\times 2025 $ grid with axis-aligned rectangles such that:\n- Each row and column contains exactly one uncovered square (forming a permutation matrix).\n- All other squares are covered by non-overlapping tiles.\n- The goal is to minimize the number of tiles.\n\nKey steps in the solution:\n1. **Permutation Matrix Reformulation:**  \n   The uncovered squares correspond to a permutation $ \\sigma $, where row $ i $ has an uncovered square at column $ \\sigma(i) $. The covered region splits into two disjoint subsets:\n   - **Left Region $ L $:** Squares $ (i, j) $ with $ j < \\sigma(i) $\n   - **Right Region $ R $:** Squares $ (i, j) $ with $ j > \\sigma(i) $\n\n2. **Universal Lower Bound via Piercing Sets:**  \n   - Define $ S_L = \\{(i, \\sigma(i) - 1) : \\sigma(i) \\geq 2\\} $. Since $ \\sigma $ is a permutation, $ |S_L| = n - 1 $ (exactly one $ i $ satisfies $ \\sigma(i) = 1 $).  \n     *Critical Property:* No rectangle can cover two distinct elements of $ S_L $. If a rectangle $ R = [a,b] \\times [c,d] $ covers $ (i, \\sigma(i)-1) $ and $ (i', \\sigma(i')-1) $, then $ d = \\sigma(i)-1 = \\sigma(i')-1 $, contradicting injectivity of $ \\sigma $. Thus, $ L $ requires at least $ n - 1 $ tiles.  \n   - Similarly, define $ S_R = \\{(i, \\sigma(i) + 1) : \\sigma(i) \\leq n - 1\\} $ with $ |S_R| = n - 1 $. No rectangle can cover two elements of $ S_R $, so $ R $ requires at least $ n - 1 $ tiles.  \n   - **Total Lower Bound:** $ 2n - 2 $ tiles for any valid configuration.\n\n3. **Achievability via Anti-Diagonal Permutation:**  \n   Using $ \\sigma(i) = n + 1 - i $ (holes on the anti-diagonal):\n   - **Tiling $ L $:** For each column $ j = 1 $ to $ n - 1 $, define vertical rectangle $ R_j^L = [1, n - j] \\times [j, j] $. These $ n - 1 $ rectangles cover all of $ L $ without overlap.  \n   - **Tiling $ R $:** For each column $ j = 2 $ to $ n $, define vertical rectangle $ R_j^R = [n + 2 - j, n] \\times [j, j] $. These $ n - 1 $ rectangles cover all of $ R $ without overlap.  \n   - **Total Tiles:** $ (n - 1) + (n - 1) = 2n - 2 $.\n\n4. **Optimality Conclusion:**  \n   The lower bound $ 2n - 2 $ is universal (holds for all permutations), and the construction achieves it. Thus, $ 2n - 2 $ is the minimum number of tiles required.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed Solution**\n\nLet $ n = 2025 $. We determine the minimum number of axis-aligned rectangular tiles needed to cover all but one square per row and column in an $ n \\times n $ grid, under the constraints that no tile overlaps and every tile aligns with grid lines.\n\n#### **Step 1: Reformulating the Problem via Permutation Matrices**\nEach row and column must contain exactly one uncovered square. These uncovered squares form a **permutation matrix**, corresponding to a bijection $ \\sigma : [n] \\to [n] $, where the uncovered square in row $ i $ is at column $ \\sigma(i) $. Denote the set of uncovered squares as $ S = \\{(i, \\sigma(i)) : i = 1, \\dots, n\\} $.\n\nThe covered region is $ T = [n] \\times [n] \\setminus S $. To satisfy the problem constraints, $ T $ must be partitioned into axis-aligned rectangles with no overlaps.\n\n#### **Step 2: Partitioning the Covered Region**\nSplit $ T $ into two disjoint subsets based on the position of the hole in each row:\n- **Left Region $ L $:** All squares $ (i, j) $ such that $ j < \\sigma(i) $\n- **Right Region $ R $:** All squares $ (i, j) $ such that $ j > \\sigma(i) $\n\nSince the hole at $ (i, \\sigma(i)) $ separates $ L $ and $ R $ in row $ i $, any rectangle covering part of $ L $ cannot extend into $ R $ in the same row (and vice versa). Rectangles are axis-aligned and contiguous, so **$ L $ and $ R $ must be tiled independently**. Thus, the minimal number of tiles is the sum of the minimal tiles required for $ L $ and $ R $.\n\n#### **Step 3: Establishing a Universal Lower Bound**\n\n##### **Lower Bound for $ L $:**\nDefine $ S_L = \\{(i, \\sigma(i) - 1) : \\sigma(i) \\geq 2\\} $.  \n- **Size of $ S_L $:** Since $ \\sigma $ is a permutation of $ [n] $, exactly one $ i $ satisfies $ \\sigma(i) = 1 $. Thus, $ n - 1 $ values of $ i $ satisfy $ \\sigma(i) \\geq 2 $, so $ |S_L| = n - 1 $.  \n- **Piercing Set Property:** Each element of $ S_L $ lies in $ L $ (as $ j = \\sigma(i) - 1 < \\sigma(i) $). Suppose two distinct elements $ (i, \\sigma(i) - 1) $ and $ (i', \\sigma(i') - 1) $ are covered by the same rectangle $ R = [a, b] \\times [c, d] \\subseteq L $.  \n  - Since $ R \\subseteq L $, for all $ k \\in [a, b] $, every column $ j \\in [c, d] $ satisfies $ j < \\sigma(k) $. Thus, $ d < \\sigma(k) $ for all $ k \\in [a, b] $. As $ d $ and $ \\sigma(k) $ are integers, $ d \\leq \\sigma(k) - 1 $.  \n  - From $ (i, \\sigma(i) - 1) \\in R $, we have $ \\sigma(i) - 1 \\leq d $. Combining with $ d \\leq \\sigma(i) - 1 $, we get $ d = \\sigma(i) - 1 $.  \n  - Similarly, $ d = \\sigma(i') - 1 $. Hence, $ \\sigma(i) = \\sigma(i') $, contradicting the injectivity of $ \\sigma $.  \n- **Conclusion:** No rectangle can cover more than one element of $ S_L $, so at least $ n - 1 $ tiles are required to tile $ L $.\n\n##### **Lower Bound for $ R $:**\nDefine $ S_R = \\{(i, \\sigma(i) + 1) : \\sigma(i) \\leq n - 1\\} $.  \n- **Size of $ S_R $:** Exactly one $ i $ satisfies $ \\sigma(i) = n $, so $ n - 1 $ values satisfy $ \\sigma(i) \\leq n - 1 $. Thus, $ |S_R| = n - 1 $.  \n- **Piercing Set Property:** Each element of $ S_R $ lies in $ R $ (as $ j = \\sigma(i) + 1 > \\sigma(i) $). Suppose two distinct elements $ (i, \\sigma(i) + 1) $ and $ (i', \\sigma(i') + 1) $ are covered by the same rectangle $ R = [a, b] \\times [c, d] \\subseteq R $.  \n  - Since $ R \\subseteq R $, for all $ k \\in [a, b] $, every column $ j \\in [c, d] $ satisfies $ j > \\sigma(k) $. Thus, $ c > \\sigma(k) $ for all $ k \\in [a, b] $. As $ c $ and $ \\sigma(k) $ are integers, $ c \\geq \\sigma(k) + 1 $.  \n  - From $ (i, \\sigma(i) + 1) \\in R $, we have $ c \\leq \\sigma(i) + 1 $. Combining with $ c \\geq \\sigma(i) + 1 $, we get $ c = \\sigma(i) + 1 $.  \n  - Similarly, $ c = \\sigma(i') + 1 $. Hence, $ \\sigma(i) = \\sigma(i') $, contradicting injectivity.  \n- **Conclusion:** No rectangle can cover more than one element of $ S_R $, so at least $ n - 1 $ tiles are required to tile $ R $.\n\n##### **Combined Lower Bound:**\nSince $ L $ and $ R $ are tiled independently, the total number of tiles is at least $ (n - 1) + (n - 1) = 2n - 2 $.\n\n#### **Step 4: Constructing an Optimal Tiling**\nWe show the lower bound $ 2n - 2 $ is achievable using the **decreasing permutation** $ \\sigma(i) = n + 1 - i $, which places uncovered squares on the anti-diagonal (i.e., $ S = \\{(i, n + 1 - i) : i = 1, \\dots, n\\} $).\n\n##### **Tiling the Left Region $ L $:**\nFor $ \\sigma(i) = n + 1 - i $, the condition $ j < \\sigma(i) $ becomes $ j < n + 1 - i $, or equivalently $ i + j < n + 1 $.  \n- For column $ j $ ($ 1 \\leq j \\leq n - 1 $), the rows satisfying $ i + j < n + 1 $ are $ i = 1, 2, \\dots, n - j $.  \n- Define the vertical rectangle $ R_j^L = [1, n - j] \\times [j, j] $. This covers all squares in column $ j $ from row $ 1 $ to $ n - j $, which are precisely the covered squares in $ L $ for column $ j $.  \n- **Verification:**  \n  - *Coverage:* For any $ (i, j) \\in L $, $ i + j < n + 1 \\implies i \\leq n - j $, so $ (i, j) \\in R_j^L $.  \n  - *Disjointness:* Rectangles $ R_j^L $ occupy distinct columns ($ j $ varies), so they do not overlap.  \n  - *Count:* There are $ n - 1 $ such rectangles (one for each $ j = 1 $ to $ n - 1 $).\n\n##### **Tiling the Right Region $ R $:**\nFor $ \\sigma(i) = n + 1 - i $, the condition $ j > \\sigma(i) $ becomes $ j > n + 1 - i $, or equivalently $ i + j > n + 1 $.  \n- For column $ j $ ($ 2 \\leq j \\leq n $), the rows satisfying $ i + j > n + 1 $ are $ i = n + 2 - j, n + 3 - j, \\dots, n $.  \n- Define the vertical rectangle $ R_j^R = [n + 2 - j, n] \\times [j, j] $. This covers all squares in column $ j $ from row $ n + 2 - j $ to $ n $, which are precisely the covered squares in $ R $ for column $ j $.  \n- **Verification:**  \n  - *Coverage:* For any $ (i, j) \\in R $, $ i + j > n + 1 \\implies i \\geq n + 2 - j $, so $ (i, j) \\in R_j^R $.  \n  - *Disjointness:* Rectangles $ R_j^R $ occupy distinct columns ($ j $ varies), so they do not overlap.  \n  - *Count:* There are $ n - 1 $ such rectangles (one for each $ j = 2 $ to $ n $).\n\n##### **Total Number of Tiles:**\n- $ n - 1 $ rectangles for $ L $  \n- $ n - 1 $ rectangles for $ R $  \nThus, the total number of tiles is $ (n - 1) + (n - 1) = 2n - 2 $.\n\n#### **Step 5: Verifying Optimality**\n- **Lower Bound Holds Universally:** Step 3 proves that for *any* permutation $ \\sigma $ (i.e., any valid placement of uncovered squares), at least $ 2n - 2 $ tiles are required.  \n- **Construction Achieves the Bound:** Step 4 provides an explicit tiling achieving exactly $ 2n - 2 $ tiles for the decreasing permutation $ \\sigma(i) = n + 1 - i $.  \n- **Conclusion:** Since the minimum number of tiles cannot be less than the universal lower bound and cannot exceed the value achieved by some configuration, $ 2n - 2 $ is the global minimum.\n\n#### **Step 6: Specializing to $ n = 2025 $**\nSubstituting $ n = 2025 $ into the formula $ 2n - 2 $:  \n$$\n2 \\cdot 2025 - 2 = 4050 - 2 = 4048\n$$\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n$$\n\\boxed{4048}\n$$",

The remaining squares are partitioned into two disjoint regions:\n   - **Left Region $ L $:** Squares where $ j < \\sigma(i) $\n   - **Right Region $ R $:** Squares where $ j > \\sigma(i) $\n\n2. **Independence of Regions:**  \n   Any rectangle must lie entirely within $ L $ or $ R $, since it cannot span across the hole in any row. Thus, the minimal number of tiles is the sum of the minimal number of rectangles needed to tile $ L $ and $ R $.\n\n3. **Lower Bound Argument:**  \n   - For region $ L $, define $ S_L = \\{(i, \\sigma(i)-1) : \\sigma(i) \\geq 2\\} $. Since $ \\sigma $ is a permutation, $ |S_L| = n - 1 $, and no two elements of $ S_L $ can be covered by the same rectangle due to the distinctness of $ \\sigma(i) $. Hence, at least $ n - 1 $ rectangles are required for $ L $.\n   - Similarly, for region $ R $, define $ S_R = \\{(i, \\sigma(i)+1) : \\sigma(i) \\leq n - 1\\} $, which also has size $ n - 1 $, requiring at least $ n - 1 $ rectangles.\n   - Therefore, the total number of tiles is at least $ 2n - 2 $.\n\n4. **Achievability of Lower Bound:**  \n   Using the decreasing permutation $ \\sigma(i) = n + 1 - i $, we construct explicit tilings:\n   - **For $ L $:** Cover each column $ j = 1 $ to $ n - 1 $ with a vertical rectangle spanning rows $ 1 $ to $ n - j $.\n   - **For $ R $:** Cover each column $ j = 2 $ to $ n $ with a vertical rectangle spanning rows $ n + 2 - j $ to $ n $.\n   - This yields exactly $ n - 1 $ rectangles for each region, totaling $ 2n - 2 $.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**  \n   The lower bound $ 2n - 2 $ is tight and achievable for all $ n \\geq 1 $, including $ n = 2025 $.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed Solution**\n\nLet $ n = 2025 $. We aim to determine the minimum number of axis-aligned rectangular tiles required to cover all but one square per row and column in an $ n \\times n $ grid, under the constraint that no tile overlaps and every tile lies on grid lines.\n\n#### **Step 1: Reformulating the Problem**\nEach row and column must contain exactly one uncovered square. These uncovered squares form a **permutation matrix**, corresponding to a bijection $ \\sigma : [n] \\to [n] $, where the uncovered square in row $ i $ is at column $ \\sigma(i) $. Denote the set of uncovered squares as $ S = \\{(i, \\sigma(i)) : i = 1, \\dots, n\\} $.\n\nDefine the **covered region** as $ T = [n] \\times [n] \\setminus S $. The task is to partition $ T $ into the fewest possible axis-aligned rectangles.\n\n#### **Step 2: Partitioning the Covered Region**\nSplit $ T $ into two disjoint subsets based on the position of the hole in each row:\n- **Left Region $ L $:** All squares $ (i, j) $ such that $ j < \\sigma(i) $\n- **Right Region $ R $:** All squares $ (i, j) $ such that $ j > \\sigma(i) $\n\nSince the hole in row $ i $ separates $ L $ and $ R $, any rectangle covering part of $ L $ cannot extend into $ R $ in the same row, and vice versa. Therefore, **any valid tiling must independently tile $ L $ and $ R $**.\n\n#### **Step 3: Lower Bound for Tiling $ L $ and $ R $**\n\n##### **Lower Bound for $ L $:**\nConsider the set $ S_L = \\{(i, \\sigma(i) - 1) : \\sigma(i) \\geq 2\\} $. Since $ \\sigma $ is a permutation, there are exactly $ n - 1 $ values of $ i $ for which $ \\sigma(i) \\geq 2 $, so $ |S_L| = n - 1 $.\n\nEach element of $ S_L $ lies in $ L $, and no two elements of $ S_L $ can be covered by the same rectangle. To see this, suppose $ (i, \\sigma(i) - 1) $ and $ (i', \\sigma(i') - 1) $ are in the same rectangle $ R = [a,b] \\times [c,d] $. Then $ \\sigma(i) - 1, \\sigma(i') - 1 \\in [c,d] $, and for all $ k \\in [a,b] $, $ d \\leq \\sigma(k) - 1 $. But then $ d = \\sigma(i) - 1 = \\sigma(i') - 1 $, contradicting the injectivity of $ \\sigma $.\n\nThus, **at least $ n - 1 $ rectangles are required to tile $ L $**.\n\n##### **Lower Bound for $ R $:**\nSimilarly, consider $ S_R = \\{(i, \\sigma(i) + 1) : \\sigma(i) \\leq n - 1\\} $. Again, $ |S_R| = n - 1 $, and no two elements of $ S_R $ can share a rectangle due to the injectivity of $ \\sigma $.\n\nHence, **at least $ n - 1 $ rectangles are required to tile $ R $**.\n\nCombining both bounds, the total number of rectangles needed is at least $ 2n - 2 $.\n\n#### **Step 4: Achieving the Lower Bound**\n\nWe now show that the lower bound $ 2n - 2 $ is achievable using the **decreasing permutation** $ \\sigma(i) = n + 1 - i $, which places holes along the anti-diagonal.\n\n##### **Tiling the Left Region $ L $:**\nFor $ \\sigma(i) = n + 1 - i $, the condition $ j < \\sigma(i) $ becomes $ j < n + 1 - i $, or equivalently $ i + j < n + 1 $. For each column $ j = 1 $ to $ n - 1 $, the rows satisfying this inequality are $ i = 1 $ to $ n - j $, forming a contiguous interval. Define the rectangle:\n$$\nR_j^L = [1, n - j] \\times [j, j]\n$$\nThis rectangle covers all squares in column $ j $ from row $ 1 $ to $ n - j $, which are precisely the covered squares in $ L $ for column $ j $. There are $ n - 1 $ such rectangles, one for each $ j = 1 $ to $ n - 1 $.\n\n##### **Tiling the Right Region $ R $:**\nFor $ \\sigma(i) = n + 1 - i $, the condition $ j > \\sigma(i) $ becomes $ j > n + 1 - i $, or $ i + j > n + 1 $. For each column $ j = 2 $ to $ n $, the rows satisfying this inequality are $ i = n + 2 - j $ to $ n $, again forming a contiguous interval. Define the rectangle:\n$$\nR_j^R = [n + 2 - j, n] \\times [j, j]\n$$\nThis rectangle covers all squares in column $ j $ from row $ n + 2 - j $ to $ n $, which are precisely the covered squares in $ R $ for column $ j $. There are $ n - 1 $ such rectangles, one for each $ j = 2 $ to $ n $.\n\n##### **Total Number of Tiles:**\n- $ n - 1 $ rectangles for $ L $\n- $ n - 1 $ rectangles for $ R $\n\nThus, the total number of tiles is:\n$$\n(n - 1) + (n - 1) = 2n - 2\n$$\n\n#### **Step 5: Verifying Optimality**\nFrom Step 3, we know that **any tiling requires at least $ 2n - 2 $ rectangles**. From Step 4, we have constructed a tiling achieving exactly $ 2n - 2 $ rectangles. Therefore, this is the **minimum** number of tiles required.\n\n#### **Step 6: Applying to $ n = 2025 $**\nSubstituting $ n = 2025 $, the minimum number of tiles is:\n$$\n2 \\cdot 2025 - 2 = 4048\n$$\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n$$\n\\boxed{4048}\n$$",
                "guard_output": "\n\n### **Summary**\n\n**Final Verdict:**  \nThe solution is **correct**. Every step is rigorously justified, and the reasoning is sound for an IMO-level problem.\n\n**List of Findings:**  \n*No issues were found.* All steps are logically valid, fully justified, and free of critical errors or justification gaps. The solution correctly establishes the lower bound of $2n-2$ tiles for any permutation of uncovered squares, constructs an explicit tiling achieving this bound for the decreasing permutation, and verifies optimality.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed Verification Log**\n\n#### **Step 1: Reformulating the Problem**\n*Quoted text:*  \n\"Each row and column must contain exactly one uncovered square. These uncovered squares form a **permutation matrix**, corresponding to a bijection $\\sigma : [n] \\to [n]$, where the uncovered square in row $i$ is at column $\\sigma(i)$. Denote the set of uncovered squares as $S = \\{(i, \\sigma(i)) : i = 1, \\dots, n\\}$.\"\n\n*Verification:*  \nThis step is **correct**. The condition that each row and column has exactly one uncovered square uniquely determines a permutation matrix, as the positions $(i, \\sigma(i))$ for a bijection $\\sigma$ satisfy the row and column constraints. The definition of $S$ is standard and accurate for permutation matrices. No gaps or errors are present.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 2: Partitioning the Covered Region**\n*Quoted text:*  \n\"Split $T$ into two disjoint subsets based on the position of the hole in each row:  \n- **Left Region $L$:** All squares $(i, j)$ such that $j < \\sigma(i)$  \n- **Right Region $R$:** All squares $(i, j)$ such that $j > \\sigma(i)$  \n\nSince the hole in row $i$ separates $L$ and $R$, any rectangle covering part of $L$ cannot extend into $R$ in the same row, and vice versa. Therefore, **any valid tiling must independently tile $L$ and $R$**.\"\n\n*Verification:*  \nThis step is **correct**. For any row $i$, the uncovered square at $(i, \\sigma(i))$ acts as a barrier: a rectangle covering squares in row $i$ must lie entirely to the left ($j < \\sigma(i)$) or entirely to the right ($j > \\sigma(i)$) of this hole to avoid covering the uncovered square (which violates the problem constraints). Since rectangles are axis-aligned and contiguous, no rectangle can span both regions in any row. Thus, $L$ and $R$ are disjoint and must be tiled separately. The reasoning is rigorous and complete.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 3: Lower Bound for Tiling $L$ and $R$**\n\n##### **Lower Bound for $L$:**\n*Quoted text:*  \n\"Consider the set $S_L = \\{(i, \\sigma(i) - 1) : \\sigma(i) \\geq 2\\}$. Since $\\sigma$ is a permutation, there are exactly $n - 1$ values of $i$ for which $\\sigma(i) \\geq 2$, so $|S_L| = n - 1$.  \n\nEach element of $S_L$ lies in $L$, and no two elements of $S_L$ can be covered by the same rectangle. To see this, suppose $(i, \\sigma(i) - 1)$ and $(i', \\sigma(i') - 1)$ are in the same rectangle $R = [a,b] \\times [c,d]$. Then $\\sigma(i) - 1, \\sigma(i') - 1 \\in [c,d]$, and for all $k \\in [a,b]$, $d \\leq \\sigma(k) - 1$. But then $d = \\sigma(i) - 1 = \\sigma(i') - 1$, contradicting the injectivity of $\\sigma$.  \n\nThus, **at least $n - 1$ rectangles are required to tile $L$**.\"\n\n*Verification:*  \n- The claim $|S_L| = n - 1$ is **correct**. As $\\sigma$ is a permutation of $[n]$, exactly one $i$ satisfies $\\sigma(i) = 1$, so $n - 1$ values satisfy $\\sigma(i) \\geq 2$. Thus, $S_L$ has $n - 1$ elements, all in $L$ (since $j = \\sigma(i) - 1 < \\sigma(i)$).  \n- The argument that no two elements of $S_L$ share a rectangle is **correct and rigorous**. Suppose $(i, \\sigma(i) - 1)$ and $(i', \\sigma(i') - 1)$ are covered by the same rectangle $R = [a,b] \\times [c,d] \\subseteq L$ (as established in Step 2, $R$ must lie entirely in $L$). Since $(i, \\sigma(i) - 1) \\in R$, we have $c \\leq \\sigma(i) - 1 \\leq d$. Similarly, $c \\leq \\sigma(i') - 1 \\leq d$. Additionally, because $R \\subseteq L$, for all $k \\in [a,b]$, every column $j$ in $R$ satisfies $j < \\sigma(k)$, so $d < \\sigma(k)$ (as $d$ is the maximum column index in $R$). Since $d$ and $\\sigma(k)$ are integers, $d \\leq \\sigma(k) - 1$ for all $k \\in [a,b]$.  \n  - For $k = i$, $d \\leq \\sigma(i) - 1$ and $d \\geq \\sigma(i) - 1$ (from $(i, \\sigma(i) - 1) \\in R$), so $d = \\sigma(i) - 1$.  \n  - For $k = i'$, similarly, $d = \\sigma(i') - 1$.  \n  - Thus, $\\sigma(i) - 1 = \\sigma(i') - 1$, implying $\\sigma(i) = \\sigma(i')$, which contradicts the injectivity of $\\sigma$.  \n  This proves that each element of $S_L$ requires a distinct rectangle, so at least $n - 1$ rectangles are needed for $L$. The reasoning is complete and avoids logical fallacies.\n\n##### **Lower Bound for $R$:**\n*Quoted text:*  \n\"Similarly, consider $S_R = \\{(i, \\sigma(i) + 1) : \\sigma(i) \\leq n - 1\\}$. Again, $|S_R| = n - 1$, and no two elements of $S_R$ can share a rectangle due to the injectivity of $\\sigma$.  \n\nHence, **at least $n - 1$ rectangles are required to tile $R$**.\"\n\n*Verification:*  \n- The claim $|S_R| = n - 1$ is **correct**. As $\\sigma$ is a permutation, exactly one $i$ satisfies $\\sigma(i) = n$, so $n - 1$ values satisfy $\\sigma(i) \\leq n - 1$. Thus, $S_R$ has $n - 1$ elements, all in $R$ (since $j = \\sigma(i) + 1 > \\sigma(i)$).  \n- The argument that no two elements of $S_R$ share a rectangle is **correct by symmetry with $S_L$**, though slightly abbreviated. The solution states it follows \"due to the injectivity of $\\sigma$\" without full elaboration, but this is acceptable for IMO level as the structure mirrors the $S_L$ case:  \n  - Suppose $(i, \\sigma(i) + 1)$ and $(i', \\sigma(i') + 1)$ are covered by the same rectangle $R = [a,b] \\times [c,d] \\subseteq R$. Then $c \\leq \\sigma(i) + 1 \\leq d$ and $c \\leq \\sigma(i') + 1 \\leq d$. Since $R \\subseteq R$, for all $k \\in [a,b]$, $c > \\sigma(k)$ (as $j \\geq c > \\sigma(k)$ for all $j$ in $R$). With integer coordinates, $c \\geq \\sigma(k) + 1$.  \n  - For $k = i$, $c \\geq \\sigma(i) + 1$ and $c \\leq \\sigma(i) + 1$ (from $(i, \\sigma(i) + 1) \\in R$), so $c = \\sigma(i) + 1$.  \n  - Similarly, $c = \\sigma(i') + 1$, implying $\\sigma(i) = \\sigma(i')$, a contradiction.  \n  The solution's reference to symmetry is sufficient; redoing the identical argument would be redundant. Thus, at least $n - 1$ rectangles are needed for $R$.  \n- Combining both bounds, the total number of rectangles is at least $(n - 1) + (n - 1) = 2n - 2$. This is **correct** and follows directly from the independence of $L$ and $R$ (Step 2).\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 4: Achieving the Lower Bound**\n*Quoted text:*  \n\"We now show that the lower bound $2n - 2$ is achievable using the **decreasing permutation** $\\sigma(i) = n + 1 - i$, which places holes along the anti-diagonal.  \n\n##### **Tiling the Left Region $L$:**  \nFor $\\sigma(i) = n + 1 - i$, the condition $j < \\sigma(i)$ becomes $j < n + 1 - i$, or equivalently $i + j < n + 1$. For each column $j = 1$ to $n - 1$, the rows satisfying this inequality are $i = 1$ to $n - j$, forming a contiguous interval. Define the rectangle:  \n$$\nR_j^L = [1, n - j] \\times [j, j]\n$$  \nThis rectangle covers all squares in column $j$ from row $1$ to $n - j$, which are precisely the covered squares in $L$ for column $j$. There are $n - 1$ such rectangles, one for each $j = 1$ to $n - 1$.  \n\n##### **Tiling the Right Region $R$:**  \nFor $\\sigma(i) = n + 1 - i$, the condition $j > \\sigma(i)$ becomes $j > n + 1 - i$, or $i + j > n + 1$. For each column $j = 2$ to $n$, the rows satisfying this inequality are $i = n + 2 - j$ to $n$, again forming a contiguous interval. Define the rectangle:  \n$$\nR_j^R = [n + 2 - j, n] \\times [j, j]\n$$  \nThis rectangle covers all squares in column $j$ from row $n + 2 - j$ to $n$, which are precisely the covered squares in $R$ for column $j$. There are $n - 1$ such rectangles, one for each $j = 2$ to $n$.  \n\n##### **Total Number of Tiles:**  \n- $n - 1$ rectangles for $L$  \n- $n - 1$ rectangles for $R$  \n\nThus, the total number of tiles is:  \n$$\n(n - 1) + (n - 1) = 2n - 2\n$$\"\n\n*Verification:*  \n- The choice of $\\sigma(i) = n + 1 - i$ (decreasing permutation) is valid, as it defines a permutation matrix with holes on the anti-diagonal.  \n- For $L$: The condition $j < \\sigma(i) = n + 1 - i$ rearranges to $i < n + 1 - j$. Since $i$ is integer-valued, $i \\leq n - j$. Thus, for fixed $j$, rows $1$ to $n - j$ in column $j$ are in $L$. The rectangle $R_j^L = [1, n - j] \\times [j, j]$ is a vertical $1 \\times (n - j)$ rectangle covering exactly these squares. As $j$ ranges from $1$ to $n - 1$, this gives $n - 1$ disjoint rectangles (different columns), all contained in $L$, with no overlaps or uncovered squares in $L$.  \n- For $R$: The condition $j > \\sigma(i) = n + 1 - i$ rearranges to $i > n + 1 - j$. Since $i$ is integer-valued, $i \\geq n + 2 - j$. Thus, for fixed $j$, rows $n + 2 - j$ to $n$ in column $j$ are in $R$. The rectangle $R_j^R = [n + 2 - j, n] \\times [j, j]$ is a vertical $1 \\times (j - 1)$ rectangle covering exactly these squares. As $j$ ranges from $2$ to $n$, this gives $n - 1$ disjoint rectangles (different columns), all contained in $R$, with no overlaps or uncovered squares in $R$.  \n- The rectangles for $L$ and $R$ are disjoint because $L$ and $R$ are disjoint (Step 2), and all tiles are axis-aligned rectangles satisfying the problem constraints (no overlaps, cover all non-hole squares).  \n- The count is exact: $n - 1$ for $L$ and $n - 1$ for $R$, totaling $2n - 2$. This construction is **rigorously verified** and achieves the lower bound from Step 3.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 5: Verifying Optimality**\n*Quoted text:*  \n\"From Step 3, we know that **any tiling requires at least $2n - 2$ rectangles**. From Step 4, we have constructed a tiling achieving exactly $2n - 2$ rectangles. Therefore, this is the **minimum** number of tiles required.\"\n\n*Verification:*  \nThis step is **correct**. Step 3 establishes that for *any* permutation $\\sigma$ (i.e., any placement of uncovered squares satisfying the row/column constraints), at least $2n - 2$ tiles are needed. Step 4 shows that for the specific permutation $\\sigma(i) = n + 1 - i$, exactly $2n - 2$ tiles suffice. Since the minimum over all valid configurations cannot exceed the value achieved for some configuration, and cannot be less than the universal lower bound, $2n - 2$ is indeed the global minimum. The logic is sound and complete.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 6: Applying to $n = 2025$**\n*Quoted text:*  \n\"Substituting $n = 2025$, the minimum number of tiles is:  \n$$\n2 \\cdot 2025 - 2 = 4048\n$$\"\n\n*Verification:*  \nThis step is **correct**. Substituting $n = 2025$ into the formula $2n - 2$ yields $4050 - 2 = 4048$. The arithmetic is accurate, and the result follows directly from the general case proven in Steps 3â€“5.\n\n---\n\n#### **Overall Assessment**\n- **Correctness of Final Answer:** The final answer $4048$ is correct, as derived from the general formula $2n - 2$ with $n = 2025$.  \n- **Logical Flow:** The solution progresses coherently: reformulation â†’ partitioning â†’ lower bound â†’ construction â†’ optimality â†’ specialization. Each step builds on the previous without gaps.  \n- **Rigor:** All claims are justified with precise mathematical reasoning. Critical steps (e.g., the lower bound argument for $S_L$) are fully elaborated, and symmetries are appropriately leveraged. No hand-waving, unjustified assumptions, or logical leaps are present.  \n- **Completeness:** The solution addresses all aspects of the problem: it proves the lower bound holds universally, constructs an optimal tiling for a specific case, and confirms minimality. Edge cases (e.g., $n=1$, though irrelevant here) align with the formula, but the focus on $n=2025$ is handled correctly.  \n\nNo errors, gaps, or flaws were identified in any step. The solution meets IMO standards for rigor and completeness."
