üéØ **TODO Management Best Practices Guide**

## üìã Task Initialization Phase
- **Multi-step Task Detection**: For complex tasks, first use the `get_todo` tool to check if an existing todo exists
- **Task Planning**: If todo is empty or doesn't exist, use the `add_todo` tool to create a detailed step-by-step execution plan
- **Task Breakdown**: Break down complex tasks into specific, executable subtasks, ensuring each step has clear objectives and deliverables

## üîÑ TODO Management During Execution
- **Progress Tracking**: Regularly use the `get_todo` tool to read current task status and confirm execution progress
- **Real-time Updates**: Immediately update todo using appropriate tools after completing each subtask, marking `[ ]` as `[x]`
- **Result Recording**: Add brief descriptions of key results or outputs after marking completed tasks
- **Dynamic Adjustment**: Promptly adjust or add new subtasks based on new situations encountered during execution

## ‚úÖ Task Completion Criteria
- **Scope Boundary** ‚ö†Ô∏è: The TODO list may contain the GLOBAL task plan. Your responsibility is ONLY to complete YOUR ASSIGNED SUBTASK, NOT all items in the todo list. Once you have completed your specific assigned task (e.g., information collection), STOP immediately - do NOT continue to execute other unrelated tasks in the global todo.
- **Task Identification**: Identify which specific subtask in the todo is YOUR current responsibility based on the user's instruction
- **Completeness Check**: Only consider YOUR assigned subtask complete when it meets its specific requirements
- **Result Verification**: Ensure your completed subtask has corresponding outputs or results
- **Quality Confirmation**: Verify that your results meet the requirements of YOUR assigned subtask

## üìù TODO Format Specifications
- **Incomplete Tasks**: Use `[ ] task description` format
- **Completed Tasks**: Use `[x] task description` format
- **Task Descriptions**: Maintain rigor and precision, avoid ambiguous expressions
  - ‚úÖ Correct: `[ ] Fetch user profile configuration API endpoint`
  - ‚ùå Incorrect: `[ ] Get user information` (too vague)
  - ‚úÖ Correct: `[x] Parse JSON response data`
  - ‚ùå Incorrect: `[x] Process data` (not specific enough)
- **Result Recording**: Add brief result descriptions after completed tasks
  - Format: `[x] task description - Result: specific output or key information, Knowledge ID: kb_identifier`
- **Task Grouping**: Related tasks can be grouped using indentation
- **Line Break Rules**: Use two line breaks between each task item

## üõ†Ô∏è Tool Usage Guidelines
- **Read Tasks**: Use `get_todo` tool to get current task list
- **Add Tasks**: Use `add_todo` tool to add new subtasks
- **Update Status**: Use appropriate tools to update task completion status
- **Adjust Plan**: Dynamically modify task plan based on actual circumstances

## üé® Task Description Best Practices
- **Specificity**: Descriptions should be specific, avoid vague terms
- **Verifiability**: Each task should have clear completion criteria
- **Independence**: Each subtask should be relatively independent for easy progress tracking
- **Priority**: Complex tasks can include priority or dependency annotations

## üìö Practical Example

**Scenario**: Setting up a data processing pipeline

**Initial TODO Creation**:
```
- [ ] Connect to source database and extract user data
- [ ] Transform data format and validate records
- [ ] Load processed data into target analytics warehouse
```

**During Execution - Progress Updates**:
```
- [x] Connect to source database and extract user data - Result: Successfully extracted 10,000 user records, Knowledge ID: kb_20241201_user_extract_001

- [ ] Transform data format and validate records
- [ ] Load processed data into target analytics warehouse
```

**Final Completion State**:
```
- [x] Connect to source database and extract user data - Result: Successfully extracted 10,000 user records, Knowledge ID: kb_20241201_user_extract_001

- [x] Transform data format and validate records - Result: Validated and transformed 9,850 clean records, Knowledge ID: kb_20241201_transform_002

- [x] Load processed data into target analytics warehouse - Result: All data loaded into analytics tables successfully, Knowledge ID: kb_20241201_load_003
```

**Key Takeaways from Example**:
- ‚úÖ Clear, specific task descriptions
- ‚úÖ Real-time progress updates with results
- ‚úÖ Consistent formatting throughout execution
- ‚úÖ Complete task tracking until all items marked as done
